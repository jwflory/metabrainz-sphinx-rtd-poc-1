Welcome to **MusicBrainz!** This beginners\' guide should get you
started on both correcting tags in your digital music and contributing
data back to MusicBrainz. If this is your first visit to this page, it
might be good to read it all before diving into more advanced topics. If
you want to dive right in anyway, the [How Tos](How_To "wikilink") are a
quite good place to do so.

MusicBrainz (often abbreviated to MB) consists of three parts:

-   The web interface and its backend, the
    [database](MusicBrainz_Database "wikilink").
-   The documentation (you\'re reading part of it!).
-   The [applications and services](Products "wikilink").

If you\'re like most users, you will probably start to tag your files
with information that was already in the database (perhaps with
[Picard](MusicBrainz_Picard "wikilink")). But remember that MusicBrainz
is user-edited, so if you find that something is missing, you can add
it, and if it is wrong, you can fix it! These changes are not always
applied instantly, because they pass through our voting system. Our
introductions [to editing](Introduction_to_Editing "wikilink") and [to
voting](Introduction_to_Voting "wikilink") will help you understand how
that works.

Documentation
-------------

The [documentation](MusicBrainz_Documentation "wikilink") includes
guides and [how-tos](:Category:How_To "wikilink"), but also the
definitions for [MusicBrainz
terminology](MusicBrainz_Terminology "wikilink") and the
[guidelines](Style "wikilink") editors are expected to follow when
editing. You don\'t need to memorise or even read all of the guidelines
from the beginning, although there are a few important ones that deal
with [titles](Style/Titles "wikilink"),
[artists](Style/Artist "wikilink") and
[releases](Style/Release "wikilink").

Web interface
-------------

Before making any changes to the data, you will need to
[register](http://musicbrainz.org/register) and then [log
in](http://musicbrainz.org/login). You will need to provide a verified
email address so that other editors can contact you. Our [privacy
policy](About/Privacy_Policy "wikilink") makes it very clear that we
don\'t share your data or spam you.

If you want to get used to the interface before you start editing real
data, you can do so at [our test page](http://test.musicbrainz.org/).
Changes made there **won\'t be applied** to the real data, so nobody
will mind you adding some junk while you get used to the editing system
on MusicBrainz. Note that this page is also where new features are
tested by our developers, so it might be slightly different from the
standard interface\... and a bit broken at times!

### Definitions

When a user modifies the data in any way, that\'s
[editing](Introduction_to_Editing "wikilink"). This is different from
the wiki-like editing you might be used to from sites like Wikipedia,
because most edits must go through a
[voting](Introduction_to_Voting "wikilink") process before being
applied.

The term [release](Release "wikilink") refers to a specific issuing of
an album, single, compilation, etc., and includes a specific set of
[recordings](recording "wikilink") in a particular order. A release
often has several different editions such as a digital iTunes edition,
or an edition with bonus tracks; these should be entered as separate
releases.

A [disc ID](Disc_ID "wikilink") is a kind of signature for a CD. It
contains the precise timing information for the CD and allows it to be
recognised automatically. When you use [MusicBrainz
Picard](MusicBrainz_Picard "wikilink"), you can automatically retrieve
the disc ID of your CD to include it in the MusicBrainz database. We
have specific documentation on [how to add disc
IDs](How_to_Add_Disc_IDs "wikilink").

One of the fundamental aims of MusicBrainz is to offer correct and well
structured information. To enforce this, we have [style
guidelines](Style "wikilink") which allow us to ensure the data input by
all users is accurate.

### Adding a release

Adding a release is probably one of the first things you will want to
do. Please note that MusicBrainz aspires to have data that is structured
in a meaningful manner and as accurate as possible, so please follow the
[style guidelines](Style "wikilink")!

If you have a CD, you can first see if MusicBrainz has a [disc
ID](Disc_ID "wikilink") for it and, if not, add a new disc ID (either to
an existing release or while adding the release itself). For that,
consult [the how-to for adding disc
IDs](How_to_Add_Disc_IDs "wikilink"). If you have other kind of release
(like a vinyl, or a digital release), or you just can\'t add a disc ID
for some reason, you will need to search for the release by hand.
Usually the best way is to search for the title of the release. If you
can\'t find the release you have, or the only matches in MusicBrainz are
reasonably different from yours (different barcode, for example), then
that means you must add the CD as a new release to the database.

See our guide on [how to add a
release](How_to_Add_a_Release "wikilink").

When submitting your new release, it helps immensely if you can provide
a link to a page containing more information about the release. Please
read [these tips for adding edit
notes](How_to_Write_Edit_Notes "wikilink") and try to follow them. A
good edit note is not only useful in the moment of adding a release, but
can also prove its use years later when some other user tries to find
more information about it. Another way of providing more information
about a release, which is especially useful if it\'s obscure and you
cannot find any links, is to upload scans or other artwork from it, as
explained in [How to Add Cover Art](How_to_Add_Cover_Art "wikilink").

While we welcome bootlegs, we discourage adding home-made compilations
or mixtapes. These kinds of releases are not widely available and any
information about them is typically only useful to the individual who
created them. Releases such as these are usually removed from our
database.

### Pending/open edits

When editing MusicBrainz, be careful about edits that are open. If there
is a pending edit (usually highlighted in yellow) you should check if it
is already doing what you wanted to do. If so, you don\'t need to do
anything - except voting Yes so it will be applied sooner! If it is
different and you don\'t agree with it, you probably should say so in an
[edit note](Edit_Note "wikilink"). Make sure you follow the [Code of
Conduct](Code_of_Conduct "wikilink") while doing so!

If you realise you\'ve made a mistake while editing, and your edit is
still open, **don\'t enter a remove edit to undo it!** You should cancel
your previous edit and make your changes again. The exception to this is
if you make a mistake when adding a release. In this case, it is usually
more efficient to leave your edit as is and create a follow up edit
correcting your mistake.

Guides
------

We have some basic guides for adding
[artists](How_to_Add_an_Artist "wikilink"),
[relationships](How_to_Add_Relationships "wikilink") and
[releases](How_to_Add_a_Release "wikilink").

And of course, you can read [our how-tos](How_To "wikilink") on
different matters.

Software
--------

You can [download MusicBrainz
Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/downloads), our tagger, to tag
your digital files and submit [disc IDs](Disc_ID "wikilink") to
MusicBrainz. If you have questions, check the [Picard
documentation](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs) and [this
illustrated how-to](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/guide). You can
install all kind of [plugins](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/plugins)
for it too!

Discussion
----------

Of course, remember that if you can\'t find an answer to some doubt in
the documentation, you can (should!) [ask about
it](Communication "wikilink").
